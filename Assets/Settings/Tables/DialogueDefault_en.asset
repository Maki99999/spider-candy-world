    m_Localized: 'Hey guys!

      Today we are again in the Maki Hotel,

      the
      biggest and only hotel in the area.

      And I see we have a nice young
      lady as a guest in our hotel today.

      Very Cool.

      Hi, what''s
      your name?

      ...

      Ahaha, probably not very talkative, I can understand.

      I
      can tell you''re new here.

      Here is a brochure.

      I can give you
      some cool fun facts about the hotel.

      Did you know that the hotel has
      over 99999 floors?

      Yes, I know, a lot.

      But: So many are necessary,
      because this is the only hotel here in the whole world.

      ...

      You
      look a little confused.

      Let''s start a bit earlier.

      We''re
      in the world of dreams here, where anything you want can happen.

      Isn''t
      that great?

      Personally, I wished that the whole world here belonged
      to me.

      And that''s why the world is now called Maki-world.

      Cool
      name, I know. Hehe.

      You look like you want to leave the dream world.

      I
      don''t understand it.

      Hmm.

      Yeah, I''m thinking if there''s
      a possibility.

      Well, one... I can think of one possibility.

      But
      I don''t think that''s a possibility for you.

      Well, maybe with a lot
      of luck it could work.

      But I don''t want to put our whole relationship
      at risk.

      So I''d rather not tell you about it.

      It''s much cooler
      here anyway, isn''t it?

      With a little practice, you could also create
      a cool maki hotel.

      That would be a good alternative to going out of
      the dream world.

      Haha, ridiculous, I haven''t even thought of something
      like that at some point.

      And if you don''t feel like creating your
      own hotel, you can just look around here at this hotel.

      I mean, it''s
      99999 unique floors.

      You won''t get bored, we have everything.

      So
      on one floor, for example, we have a huge swimming pool,

      then in another
      room we have a huge ball pool. So there is really something for everyone.

      And
      you can look for a new floor every day and it just doesn''t get boring.

      There
      are beds, too, of course, as you''ve probably already seen.

      And I said
      that there are over 99999 floors,

      but in fact it''s already the infinite-fold
      of it approximately so estimated.

      so yes ne? Have fun exploring!

      Oh,
      before I forget:

      Floor 99999 is under renovation right now, so that
      could be dangerous, so please don''t go there.

      And there is a private
      party on floor 19980203.

      So bypass these two floors, okay?

      Don''t
      forget: ignore floors 99999 and 19980203 and don''t visit them, okay?

      Don''t.
      Visit.

      Okay?

      Have fun!
